<h1>My Closet Organizer</h1>
<h2>My daughter needed a way to catalog all of her clothes so she could shop more efficiently--and save money! This handy, responsive app allows users to upload photos of their clothes, create outfits, and even decide if new additions will "work" with existing pieces.</h2>
<h3>**Currently designed with local authentication with plans to add Google OAuth and Azure AD in the near future**</h3>
<p>App was created using Bootstrap 5, CSS, EJS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Cloudinary and uploaded to Heroku</p>
